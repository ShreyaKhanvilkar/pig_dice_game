In this game, (any number of) players will take turns "rolling" a die to get 30 or more points!
A player can roll as many times as they'd like before they "hold" their score and pass their die to the next opponent.
If, however, they roll a 1, their score resets back to zero and it's their opponent's turn.
Players will continue taking turns until, in the end, the player with a score of 30 or more wins.
